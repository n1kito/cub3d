Our work on the 42Born2Code <b>cub3d</b> project.<br /><br />
</p>

>  This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way.
