Our work on the 42Born2Code <b>cub3d</b> project.<br /><br />
</p>

>  This project is inspired by the world-famous Wolfenstein 3D game, which was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you‚Äôll have to find your way.

# Research

## Parsing

**How to check that the map is closed**
- For each charcter of the map, we check if it's on the edge (if one of its neigbors is NULL) and if so that it's a `1`. `P` or `0` should never neighbor an empty char.
